# Arduino-Lcd-Distance-Meter


In this Project I tryed to use my Arduino to measure the distance. 
For this I used as I sayed my Micro Controller (You can use every Micro Controller, even one without WLAN), an Ultrasonic Distance Sensor, an LCD 1620 module with an external I2C module and some Jumper wires.
You can see the setup at the .png file.
